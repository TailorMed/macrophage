# Macrophage - an API-level test-macro runner

## Disclaimer

**NOTE:** This is a very preliminary version, taking the common-parts that do not contain secret sauce from a proprietary project.
I hope to provide examples and tutorials soon.

## Overview

- Test Suites are described using a simplified yaml-based macro-language
- Suites are built of Steps, which are built of directives, which are configured per instance.
- Support for custom hooks for developer-Level customization.
- Support for custom clients


## Roadmap
- Integral support for open-api-spec (f.k.a swagger) clients
- Integral support for advanced checkers
